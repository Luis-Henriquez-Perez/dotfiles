<h1 align="center">dotfiles</h1>

These are my dotfiles. They are managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

- **simple as possible**  
  Although many Linux users go too far with it, there is truth to the KISS doctrine of keeping things as simple as possible.
- **easy to setup**  
  I want to be able to run just one command or script to set up all of my dotfiles. I have not achieved this yet, but I am working on it.
- **well-documented**  
  Setting up these dotfiles was hard for me to do. I want to help others reading set up their own dotfiles and to do that. Also, I want to remember things that I myself did.

## Featured Programs
Here I'll talk briefly about some of the programs I choose and why I choose them.

- For dotfile management, I am using a Git bare repository. Prior to this, I had been using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/); however, I found it a bit too overblown for my needs. Now I use:
  - [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/)  
    At first, I was using StumpWM, and I have got to say I do love Lisp, but StumpWM was a bit slow and in fact, the first two weeks I used it, it crashed at least 5 times. In any case, AwesomeWM is lightweight, fast, written in a real programming language, and extremely customizable.
  - [stumpwm](https://stumpwm.github.io/)  
    As I have mentioned, I am attracted to customizable applications, particularly ones written in Lisp.
  - [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)  
    Emacs is my editor (see my [dedicated README](./dot_config/emacs/README.org)).

## Designated Operating System
I use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) as my operating system.
