# I used the bullet headings in this file because having mutiple comment
# syntaxes next to each other does not work in this file.  Is it a bug?  I
# confirmed additionally that this is also the case for lua files.  I think I
# have to either try to fix this myself in the outshine code or just switch to
# the bullet syntax, at least for non-elisp files.
