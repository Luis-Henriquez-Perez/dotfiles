# I used the bullet headings in this file because having mutiple comment
# syntaxes next to each other does not work in this file.  Is it a bug?  I
# confirmed additionally that this is also the case for lua files.  I think I
# have to either try to fix this myself in the outshine code or just switch to
# the bullet syntax, at least for non-elisp files.

### set emacsclient as my preferred editor
# Indicate to the shell (or bash?) that I want to use emacsclient as my editor
# of choice when opening a file to read with a terminal program.  This taken
# as advice from [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient][the emacs wiki]].

# On a side note, I have got to say that I wished I were writing this headline
# in org.  This is exactly what I am talking about with the power of org.  If it
# had been in org I would have had this heading as a subtree of the "emacs"
# heading, putting all the stuff that pertains to emacs in one place because
# that is the easiest way for me to think about these things.  But since I am
# not using org, I am more or less tied to having to follow the rules.
export ALTERNATE_EDITOR=""
# Using the argument =-c= would make emacs open in the terminal.  But obviously
# I would rather open with the GUI.
export EDITOR="emacsclient -c"                  # $EDITOR opens in GUI mode
export VISUAL="emacsclient -c -a emacs"         # $VISUAL opens in GUI mode

### add [[https://roswell.github.io/Home.html][roswell]] to path
# This was recommended by [[https://lem-project.github.io/installation/ncurses/linux/][lem github.io website]]. To be honest I am not sure how
# good of an idea it was to install things via roswell.  To some extent I feel
# that it makes things more complicated because now it seems like I have two
# different package managers (I am not counting emacs's).  Not that I think ros
# is bad or anything, it is just that I think its overkill for my purposes at
# the current moment.  The additional complexity does not benefit me.  It seems
# more geared to testing different versions of sbcl, which I am not doing right
# now.
export PATH=$PATH:~/.roswell/bin

# Provided by the package [[][eat]].  I am not sure if I want to keep this.
# Honestly, I just want to see the support the package spoke about.
