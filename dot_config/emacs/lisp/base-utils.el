;; This function is very similar to dash's [[file:snapshots/_helpful_function__-first_.png][-first]] or cl-lib's [[file:snapshots/_helpful_function__cl-find-if_.png][cl-find-if]].
;; These functions take a predicate and a list and they return the first element of
;; the list for which ~(pred element)~ returns non-nil.  The function =oo-first-success= also takes a
;; predicate and the list, but instead it returns the first non-nil return value of
;; ~(pred element)~.  For example, ~(oo-first-sucess 'numberp '(a t 0))~ would return
;; =t= instead of =0= as it would for =-first= or =cl-find-if= because ~(numberp 0)~ evaluates
;; to =t=. The name of this function is inspired by a similar function designed for
;; hooks [[file:snapshots/_helpful_function__run-hooks-with-args-until-success_.png][run-hook-with-args-until-success]].
