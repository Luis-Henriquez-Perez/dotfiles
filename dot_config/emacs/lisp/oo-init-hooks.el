;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains all the "base" hooks that trigger all other hooks.  Or in
;; other words, the hooks that cannot go into "after-load" files.
;;
;;; Code:
(require 'base)
;;;; hooks
;; I had been organizing the init file by packages and that is not entirely
;; useless but I think maybe an abstraction in which I look at what is happening
;; when as opposed to the configuration for over 50 individual packages.  The
;; focus is now on what is happening in my configuration as opposed to the many
;; individual configurations.

;; To ensure that =oo-override-mode-map= takes priority over evil states, we need

;; override an evil keymap).

;;;;; load macros for init file
;; The macros in my configuration are expanded during compilation thereby saving
;; time because they do not need to be expanded during startup.  The one caviat
;; is that since they are already expanded at runtime my emacs configuration
;; will have no knowledge of them.  The `oo-macros' file will not be loaded at
;; all.  And again this is great for reducing startup time but I still want the
;; macros to be defined when I am actually editing emacs-lisp.  Therefore, I
;; load the `oo-macros' file.
