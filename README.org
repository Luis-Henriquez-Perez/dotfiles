- *keep it simple*
  Although many go too far with it, there is truth to the
  KISS doctrine of keeping things as simple as possible.
- *ease of setup*
  I want to be able to run just one command or script to set up
  all of my dotfiles.  I have not achieved this yet but I am working on it.

  help others reading set up their own dotfiles and to do that.  Also I want to
  remember things that I myself did.

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] Emacs is my editor (see my [[file:./dot_config/emacs/README.org][dedicated README]])
** designated operating system
I use [[https://archlinux.org/][archlinux]] as my operating system.
