* Principles
- *keep it simple*
- *ease of setup*
  I should be able to setup my dotfiles with a single command.
- *thorough documentation*
  Setting up these dotfiles was hard for me to do.  I want to
  help others reading set up their own dotfiles and to do that.  Also I want to
  remember things that I myself did.
** Featured Programs
- *Dotfile Management*: git I manage my dotfiles using a [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles][bare git repo]].  Compared to
  existing solutions--namely [[https://yadm.io/][yadm]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][gnu stow]] and [[https://www.chezmoi.io/][chezmoi]]--it requires no
  dependencies besides git, it does not use symlinks, and it is overall much
  simpler.  It is major drawback is it is more difficult to use tools that
  integrate with.
- *Window Manager*: [[https://awesomewm.org/][awesomewm]]
  At first I was using stumpwm and I have got to say I do love lisp,
  but stumpwm was a bit slow and in fact the first two weeks I used it it
  crashed at least 5 times.  In any case, awesomewm is lightweight it is fast,
  it is written in a real programming language and it is extremely customizable.
  [[https://stumpwm.github.io/][stumpwm]] As I have mentioned I am attracted to customizable applications and
  Particularly ones written in lisp.  In this sense.
- *Editor*:
  [[Https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] is my editor (see my [[file:./dot_config/emacs/README.org][dedicated README]]).  Emacs is the "centerpice" of my
  configuration.  It is my most configured package.
** Designated Operating System
I use [[https://archlinux.org/][archlinux]] as my operating system.
** How To Initialize My Dotfiles (NOT YET WORKING)
Run the following command which will download the [[~/scripts/dotinit.sh][dotinit.sh]] and run it.  The
script clones my dotfiles as a bare git repo and attempts to propagate the files
on my dotfiles to the home directory via ~git checkout~.  If ~git checkout~ fails
due because of files that would be overwritten by doing this checkout, then my
script creates a backup directory and moves the files there and tries again.
#+begin_src bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/Luis-Henriquez-Perez/dotfiles/master/dotinit.sh | bash
#+end_src
At the moment, the script has a few problems:
1. it does not create a uniquely named backup directory
2. it might not successfully move the files
   The script relies figuring out which files would be overwritten by using the
   git checkout failure message which lists those files.  But as I have learned
   if there are enough files that would be overwritten the list might get cut
   off and not all of the overwritten files would be moved, resulting in another
   git checkout failure.
