* Principles
- *keep it simple*

- *ease of setup*
  I should be able to setup my dotfiles with a single command.
- *thorough documentation* I want to help others reading set up their own dotfiles
  and to do that.  Also I want to remember things that I myself did.
* Notable Highlights
- *Operating System*: [[https://archlinux.org/][archlinux]]
  Arch is a simple and minimal linux distro.  I have the most experience with it
  than any other distro.  I may switch to Debian or Devuan in the short term
  future because of wanting more stability for my system.  I am also drawn to
  [[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]] and [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] for their promise of complete reproduceability.
- *Dotfile Management*: I manage my dotfiles using a [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles][bare git repo]].  Compared to
  existing solutions--namely [[https://yadm.io/][yadm]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][gnu stow]] and [[https://www.chezmoi.io/][chezmoi]]--it requires no
  dependencies besides git, it does not use symlinks, and it is overall much
  simpler.  It is major drawback is it is more difficult to use tools that
  integrate with.
- *Window Manager*: [[https://awesomewm.org/][awesomewm]]
  At first I was using stumpwm and I have got to say I do love lisp,
  but stumpwm was a bit slow and in fact the first two weeks I used it it
  crashed at least 5 times.  In any case, awesomewm is lightweight it is fast,
  it is written in a real programming language and it is extremely customizable.
  [[https://stumpwm.github.io/][stumpwm]] As I have mentioned I am attracted to customizable applications and
  Particularly ones written in lisp.  I am considering moving towards
  [[https://nixos.org/][qtile]] because I am more familiar with python than lua.  And I would
  rather use.
- *Editor*:
  [[Https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] is my editor (see my [[file:./dot_config/emacs/README.org][dedicated README]]).  Emacs is the "centerpice" of my
  configuration.  It is my most configured package and where do most of my work.
  Check out its [[][dedicated README]].
* Initializing My Dotfiles (NOT YET WORKING)
Run the following command which will download the [[~/scripts/dotinit.sh][dotinit.sh]] and run it.  The
script clones my dotfiles as a bare git repo and attempts to propagate the files
on my dotfiles to the home directory via ~git checkout~.  If ~git checkout~ fails
due because of files that would be overwritten by doing this checkout, then my
script creates a backup directory, moves the files there and tries again.
#+begin_src bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/Luis-Henriquez-Perez/dotfiles/| sh
#+end_src
At the moment, the script has a few problems.
1. it does not create a uniquely named backup directory
2. it might not successfully move the files
   The script relies figuring out which files would be overwritten by using the
   git checkout failure message which lists those files.  But as I have learned
   if there are enough files that would be overwritten the list might get cut
   off and not all of the overwritten files would be moved, resulting in another
   git checkout failure.
