# although it looks cool with the tiling I am not convinced
- *keep it simple*
  Although many go too far with it, there is truth to the
  KISS doctrine of keeping things as simple as possible.
- *ease of setup*
  I want to be able to run just one command or script to set up
  all of my dotfiles.  I have not achieved this yet but I am working on it.
- *thorough documentation*
  Setting up these dotfiles was hard for me to do.  I want to
  help others reading set up their own dotfiles and to do that.  Also I want to
  remember things that I myself did.
** featured programs
- *dotfile management*
  For dotfile management I am using.  Compared to existing
  solution I have tried--namely [[https://yadm.io/][yadm]], [[][gnu stow]] and [[][chezmoi]].
- *window manager*
  [[https://awesomewm.org/][awesomewm]] At first I was using stumpwm and I have got to say I do love lisp,
  but stumpwm was a bit slow and in fact the first two weeks I used it it
  crashed at least 5 times.  In any case, awesomewm is lightweight it is fast,
  it is written in a real programming language and it is extremely customizable.
  [[https://stumpwm.github.io/][stumpwm]] As I have mentioned I am attracted to customizable applications and
  Particularly ones written in lisp.  In this sense.
- *editor*

  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] Emacs is my editor (see my [[file:./dot_config/emacs/README.org][dedicated README]])
** designated operating system
I use [[https://archlinux.org/][archlinux]] as my operating system.
** how to initialize dotfiles
